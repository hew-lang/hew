// We need two modules ending in the same name.
// Since we can't easily create multi-file modules in this environment without a build system,
// I'll try to simulate it if I can, or at least reason about it.

// Ideally I would do:
// import std::string
// import my::string
// string.foo() -> ambiguous or wrong

fn main() {
  // This is a placeholder as I verify the logic.
}
