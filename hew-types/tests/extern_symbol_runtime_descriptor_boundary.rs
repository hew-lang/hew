//! `checker-output-boundary`: an `#[extern_symbol]` FFI method must NOT be
//! reclassified into a typed runtime-call descriptor, even when its resolved C
//! symbol string collides with a [`RuntimeCallFamily`] catalog name.
//!
//! The typed `RewriteToFunction.descriptor` is reserved for closed-set builtin
//! calls the checker resolves with first-class family knowledge. Open-set
//! `#[extern_symbol]` symbols — stdlib `duration` / `Instant` /
//! `LambdaActorHandle` bindings as well as user-authored FFI on inherent impls
//! — are open-set *by mechanism*: their family is only recoverable by
//! reverse-parsing the symbol string. So they carry `descriptor: None` and
//! consumers fall back to the raw `c_symbol`.
//!
//! Regression guard for the seam where a single rewrite recorder reverse-parsed
//! the resolved C symbol into a descriptor for *every* producer — including the
//! open-set `#[extern_symbol]` path — so a user FFI binding (or a stdlib
//! `#[extern_symbol]` method) whose symbol matched a catalog entry was silently
//! lifted into a runtime ABI descriptor. These tests FAIL if that single-path
//! reverse-parse is reintroduced: the `from_c_symbol(..).is_some()` precondition
//! proves the symbol IS a catalog member, so a `Some` descriptor here can only
//! mean the extern method was reclassified.
